I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Information and Data Science at UC Berkeley but I graduated from UW-Madison with a Data Science Major and Computer Science Minor. I have an aspiring passion for sports, technology and finance. I have worked collaboratively across teams in several research projects equipping me skills in Python, R, SQL and Tableau as well as strong written and oral skills. I am actively seeking job opportunities where I can apply my passion for leveraging data to drive strategic business decisions.

Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or would like to learn more about me!
