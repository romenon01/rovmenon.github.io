# Projects

Here are some of the projects that I've completed and what I am currently working on:

**Major City Classification utilizing Deep Learning Models**:

**Date**: January 2024 to May 2024

**Software Used**: Python

As part of a class project, I collaborated on a deep learning project focused on predicting location based on major city photos. Developed a CNN architecture, including a custom model and ResNet-based variants finally creating a Gradio interface for seamless interaction with the model, enabling a real-time prediction of city locations from images with a 40% accuracy.

**Roadside Reflectors Impact on Nighttime Driving Speeds**:

**Date**:  January 2024 to May 2024

**Software Used**: R

In this group project, we utilized A/B testing methodology to investigate the impact of roadside reflectors on nighttime driving speeds, analyzing whether their presence influences drivers' speed behavior. We achieved statistical significance with a sample size exceeding 800 cars, providing robust evidence on whether roadside reflectors induce significant changes in nighttime driving speeds.

**Drive for Success: Analyzing the Top 200 Players in the PGA Tour**:

**Date**: January 2024 to May 2024

**Software Used**: Tableau

In this project, we crafted an interactive Tableau dashboard investigating performance metrics of the top 200 players on the PGA Tour, offering insights into driving, approach, recovery, and putting while also diving into the relationship between player performance and course characteristics.

**Classifying NFL Offensive Play Types**:

**Date**: September 2021 to December 2021

**Software Used**: Python

In this project, my goal was to determine whether NFL Offensive Plays can be predicted and classified by use of machine learning models. If successful, the ideal model could be used to assist a defensive team in devising strategies that are meant to counter a team that is known to execute certain types of plays. Specifically, I used NFL data from the 2020 season and created two Python notebook files: the first notebook was used to perform data cleaning, which consisted of removing plays in a column with specific conditions, verifying that the column is not null, standardizing certain values through mapping, and saving the data as a CSV file. Moreover, the second notebook was used to perform feature selection, encode categorical variables, and the primary model training steps. These steps included splitting the data into training and test sets, training the model using the training data, evaluating the model using training and validation sets, and printing out the model's performance scores. Some models used in the analysis include Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, Bagging, Adaptive Boosting, and Stacking.
