# Projects

Here are some of the notable projects that I've completed in the past and will be updated with new ones soon!

**Major City Classification utilizing Deep Learning Models**:

**Date**: January 2024 to May 2024

**Software Used**: Python

As part of a class project, I collaborated on a deep learning project focused on predicting location based on major city photos. Developed a CNN architecture, including a custom model and ResNet-based variants finally creating a Gradio interface for seamless interaction with the model, enabling a real-time prediction of city locations from images with a 40% accuracy.

**Roadside Reflectors Impact on Nighttime Driving Speeds**:

**Date**:  January 2024 to May 2024

**Software Used**: R

In this group project, we utilized A/B testing methodology to investigate the impact of roadside reflectors on nighttime driving speeds, analyzing whether their presence influences drivers' speed behavior. We achieved statistical significance with a sample size exceeding 800 cars, providing robust evidence on whether roadside reflectors induce significant changes in nighttime driving speeds.

**Drive for Success: Analyzing the Top 200 Players in the PGA Tour**:

**Date**: January 2024 to May 2024

**Software Used**: Tableau

In this project, we crafted an interactive Tableau dashboard investigating performance metrics of the top 200 players on the PGA Tour, offering insights into driving, approach, recovery, and putting while also diving into the relationship between player performance and course characteristics.

**Estimating Song Popularity on the Spotify platform**:

**Date**: September 2023 to December 2023

**Software Used**: R

In this project, we worked with various R packages to develop OLS regression models for estimating song popularity on the Spotify platform. Utilized Spotify API data with around 30,000 tracks from Kaggle filtering for the Pop genre Performed EDA on the data narrowing the focus to loudness with popularity along with additional covariates for our model.

**Classifying NFL Offensive Play Types**:

**Date**: September 2021 to December 2021

**Software Used**: Python

In this group project during my undergrad, our goal was to predict football play types during drives based on game features, utilizing ML classifier models on historical play-by-play football data. We Streamlined training and testing processes by filtering, cleaning, and transforming necessary columns using Pandas, implemented a baseline decision tree (based on Down and Yards to Go) to validate play prediction intuition and expanded model accuracy using sklearn library with k-nearest-neighbors, RandomForest, Bagging, Adaptive Boosting, and a Stacking
classifier.
